# Some infos :

This is an exercice done as a student while participating at the training of LE REACTEUR , in Paris.
This is a first step in BACKEND features development for me .

The purpose was to recreate a backend feature inspired by the app vinted (simulating cases of requests from users about offers ), test it with given datas (connecting localhost server to a database with MongoDB) using the software Postman. Then push this working feature into a GITHUB repository .

Well, this is working !

Next step will be to host this work and deploy it with HEROKU.
